My name is Mati, and I have been addicted to Agentic Engineering since June 2025.

Here I share what I find useful, hope it helps.

I worked at SoundCloud and other startups. Now I am working on the media platform for the GenAI era.

I am based in Berlin, and I travel often to San Francisco.

And I love dogs. This is my dog Freja.
