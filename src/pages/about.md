Building AI-powered software feels like having superpowers.

I've shipped products in Swift and recently fell in love with Rust. Former SoundCloud engineer now exploring the intersection of systems programming and AI.

Based in Berlin, where you'll often find me coding on my boat with my dog as co-pilot.

## What I Write About

I share things that I find worth documenting - from technical deep dives into AI and systems programming to thoughts on building software that matters. If you find something useful here, that makes me happy.

## Connect

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/matiasvillaverde) where I share my open source work.

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss AI, Rust, or life on the water.
