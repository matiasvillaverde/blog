My name is Mati, and I have been addicted to Agentic Engineering since June 2025.

Here I share what I find useful, hope it helps.

I worked at SoundCloud and other startups. Now I am working on the media platform for the GenAI era.
I love dogs. This is my dog Freja.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/matiasvillaverde) where I share my open source work.

I spend most of my time in Berlin, Warsaw, and San Francisco.

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss Agentic Engineering, DIY projects, or dogs.
